# Vending Machine - Project H.E.R.O. (Healing Emergency Response to Overdose) 

## Overview

Project H.E.R.O. is an initiative by Jubilee House Community focused on harm reduction and overdose prevention. By providing 24/7 access to free naloxone (Narcan) and other harm reduction materials, Project H.E.R.O. aims to eliminate barriers related to access, stigma, and shame. The first naloxone vending machine is proudly located at the new Town Hall in Parrish, Alabama.

## Mission

HOPE, HOSPITALITY, AND HARM REDUCTIONAt Jubilee House, we believe harm reduction is fundamental to our mission of spreading good news and supporting our community. Project H.E.R.O. is a reflection of our commitment to providing hope, hospitality, and life-saving resources to those in need.

## Features

24/7 Access to Naloxone: Free naloxone available through strategically placed vending machines.

Harm Reduction Materials: Access to other essential harm reduction supplies.

Community Involvement: Opportunities for volunteers to package naloxone kits and participate in monthly door-to-door distributions.

Innovative Vending Solutions: Our first vending machine in Parrish, AL, is a pioneering effort to provide harm reduction tools through a repurposed vending machine, adapted using open-source hardware solutions for reliability.

## Technical Details

Project H.E.R.O.'s vending machine faced significant challenges due to outdated hardware and environmental conditions. The internal computer system relied on drop sensors and temperature controls that often malfunctioned, halting distribution.

## Current Technical Solutions:

Simplified Hardware: We're working to replace complex internal systems with Arduino-based controllers to bypass unnecessary sensors and streamline Narcan distribution.

Community Collaboration: Our GitHub repository Project H.E.R.O. Vending hosts all open-source code and schematics for adapting vending machines for harm reduction.

Future Scalability: By refining these solutions, we aim to replicate and expand vending machine access across multiple locations.
